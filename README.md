User story: As a returning user, I want to easily complete onboarding so that I can quickly access full product value.
Rationale: Based on KPI evidence ({"onboarding_completion_rate":0.1,"analysis_summary":"I'll run a complete UX experimentation cycle for your project. Let me start by analyzing the current state of your onboarding metrics and then propose improvements.\n\n## Step 1: Check Current KPIs and Tracking"}), applying template add_onboarding_nav_link with params {"linkText":"Finish Onboarding","urlPath":"/onboarding","priority":"high"} is likely to reduce drop-off.
Risks: Low risk. Changes are additive (navigation entry). Provide rollback by removing the link if metrics degrade.

Parameters: {"linkText":"Finish Onboarding","urlPath":"/onboarding","priority":"high"}
