User story:
As a returning user, I want to easily complete onboarding so that I can quickly access full product value.

Rationale:
Based on KPI evidence ({"onboarding_completion_rate":0.1,"analysis_summary":"I'll run a complete experimentation cycle for your project. Let me start by checking the current KPIs and tracking setup for the improve_onboarding goal."}), applying template add_onboarding_nav_link with params {"linkText":"Finish Onboarding","urlPath":"/onboarding","priority":"high"} is likely to reduce drop-off.

Risks:
Low risk. Changes are additive (navigation entry). Provide rollback by removing the link if metrics degrade.

Parameters:
{
  "linkText": "Finish Onboarding",
  "urlPath": "/onboarding",
  "priority": "high"
}
